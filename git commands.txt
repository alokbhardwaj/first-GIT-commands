Following steps will help in cloning a repo that you created on github or forked

a) making a new repository on github
1. make a new repository on git hub using the 'new repository' option displayed on clicking your name on the github website
2.make the repository public, give some message and include the readme.md

b)copying repo on local machine 
3.to copy this repository on the local machine; open gitbash and type  git clone <url of the repository>
the url is obtained from the page of the repository on github bottom right. copy the url on billboard and press 'insert' while you are on gitbash
4. you will see a new directory by the name of the repository
go into that directory: cd <directory name>
5.To create a new markdown file, we can use the following:
touch new.md

c)checking status of the local copy of repo
6.type git status to check the status of the file

d) make some changes to the directory by adding a new file or modifying the existing files
7. its time to stage the changes made to the directory by typing: git add .
8. its time to commit by typing: git commit -m "this is a first git commands"
9. git status
10.git log

e)getting repo from local machine to github
11. to get repository from local machine to github on master branch type following:
git push origin master
type username and password


Following is the way to create a repo on local machine first and then pushing that on github (given you already created the repo on github to which you want to sync the loca repo)

1)mkdir ~/test-repo
2)cd ~/test-repo
3)git init to initialize the local git repo
4)git remote add origin <url of repo on github>
5)git push origin master. it will not work
this will give an error because the local repo doesn't contain the readme.md file that was created on github repo
To counter this type on gitbash
6) git pull origin master
7)type again git push origin master

However, I have not included the syncing aspect of forking that includes fetching and merging
